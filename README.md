# Predicting what pediatric patients will receive blood products in the time range of 2011 to 2017

This was a real-world project for the Hospitals System and colleagues.

The Revisit Hermann file is from my Doctoral Dissertation where i was looking into the petiatric patients that were received to the hospital and if they received bllod products or not. This helped the hospital system develop protocols and insights into what they could do to make their systems more efficient. The fila is trying to predict based on input features what individuals may need to receive blood products. Random Forest, Logisitc Regression, and XGBoost machine learning models were used. The XGBoost proved the most fuitful and was used to run a stats models logisitic regression to look at the magnitude of the relationship between the top 10 most influential features, after a feature importance analysis was completed.
