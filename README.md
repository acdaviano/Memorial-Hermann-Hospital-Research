# Predicting what pediatric patients will receive blood products in the time range of 2011 to 2017

This was a real-world project for the Hospitals System and colleagues.

The Revisit Hermann file is from my Doctoral Dissertation where i was looking into the petiatric patients that were received to the hospital and if they received bllod products or not. This helped the hospital system develop protocols and insights into what they could do to make their systems more efficient. The fila is trying to predict based on input features what individuals may need to receive blood products. Random Forest, Logisitc Regression, and XGBoost machine learning models were used. The XGBoost proved the most fuitful and was used to run a stats models logisitic regression to look at the magnitude of the relationship between the top 10 most influential features, after a feature importance analysis was completed.


# Clustering what patients exist that receive blood products at Memorial Hermann Hospital Houston in the time range of 2011 to 2017

Again this was a real-world project. 

The Hermann unsupervised learning file is a file that looks to use clustering in a predictive way with KModes, HDBSCAN, and HCA (agglomerative). This was to see if one could use the clustering algorithms to correctly predict the pediatric patients that needed blood products, between 2011 and 2017 and were transported to Memorial Hermann Hospital, while in also looking for new insight with both HCA and HDBSCAN to explore what clusters may be present in the data where patients did receive blood products. means, medians, and correlations were used with the non-ground truth clusters found in the laddr portion of the project to see if sense could be made from the clusters.
